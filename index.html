    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">For Game Hub • Effective: <span id="effective-date">2025-10-26</span></div>

    <p>Game Hub ("we", "us", or "our") provides a mobile and web application that helps you discover and play games. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the application.</p>

    <div class="card small">
      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We do not require you to create an account. We store limited data on your device (e.g., language preference and cached game listings). We use third-party services such as Google AdMob to show ads, which may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad delivery and measurement. When you open external games, you will visit third‑party sites governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Information you provide:</strong> The app does not ask you to register or submit personal information directly.</p>
    <p><strong>Information collected automatically:</strong> When you use the app, we and our service providers may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device and usage data (e.g., device model, operating system, app version, general device capabilities).</li>
      <li>IP address and coarse location inferred from IP for fraud prevention and ad delivery.</li>
      <li>Diagnostic data and error events to maintain the app’s stability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Local storage on your device:</strong> The app stores small amounts of data locally on your device, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>games</code> — cached game catalog data for faster loading.</li>
      <li><code>appLanguage</code> — your chosen language preference.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can clear this data in the app/browser settings (e.g., clearing app storage or site data).</p>

    <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>We integrate third‑party services that may process data independently:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (ads and measurement). AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as Advertising ID), IP address, and interaction data to deliver and measure ads. Learn more at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ads Policy</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google uses information from apps</a>. You can opt out of personalized advertising via your device settings (see “Your Choices”).</li>
      <li><strong>In‑App Browser / External Sites</strong>. When you open a game, the app may launch an in‑app browser to a third‑party site. Your use of those sites is governed by their own privacy policies and terms; we are not responsible for their practices.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Hosting (GitHub)</strong>. The app retrieves game listings from GitHub-hosted content. GitHub may receive standard request information (e.g., IP address, user agent) when your device requests those files. See the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the app and its features.</li>
      <li>Cache content and remember your language preference.</li>
      <li>Show and measure advertising and limit fraud/abuse.</li>
      <li>Maintain performance, fix bugs, and improve reliability.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EEA/UK, we process personal data under these legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Performance of contract</strong> to provide the app’s core functionality.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> for app security, fraud prevention, and non‑personalized ads/measurement.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong> where required for storing/reading identifiers or for personalized ads. You can withdraw consent at any time in your device settings (see below).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>With service providers and partners that help operate the app (e.g., AdMob).</li>
      <li>When required by law or to protect our rights and users.</li>
      <li>In connection with a business transfer (e.g., merger, sale of assets).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clear local data</strong>: Clear the app’s storage or your browser/site data to remove cached content and preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Ad preferences</strong>: Use device settings to limit or reset the Advertising ID and to opt out of personalized ads:
        <ul>
          <li>Android: Settings → Google → Ads → “Opt out of Ads Personalization” (or “Delete advertising ID”).</li>
          <li>iOS: Settings → Privacy → Tracking → disable “Allow Apps to Request to Track”.</li>
        </ul>
        See also <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppChoices</a> and <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAI Mobile Choices</a>.
      </li>
      <li><strong>External sites</strong>: Review third‑party game providers’ privacy policies before using their sites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13 (or under the age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain locally stored data on your device only as long as it remains in your app/browser storage. Third‑party partners may retain data according to their own policies.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable measures to help protect information. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed in countries that may not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the use of your personal information. You may also have the right to object to processing or to portability. To exercise rights, contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective” date above and, if changes are material, provide additional notice as required by law.</p>
